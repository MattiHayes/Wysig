# Wysig

**Wysig** is a terminal based text editor written in C. 

This project was inspired by [kilo](https://viewsourcecode.org/snaptoken/kilo/index.html). I have looked at parts of the kilo tutorial however, my goal is to build this as independently as possible. I will write my own code  mostly from scratch. Google is my first stop when I get stuck and I use AI as a sounding board - not as a code generator. 

## Explanation of Parts

So the first step was to disable "cooked" mode where the terminal echos what has been entered from 
the keyboard. This required the use of `termios.h`.
